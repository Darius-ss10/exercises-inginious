    In the small Internet shown below, ``AS4`` announces one prefix : ``2001:db8:4/48``. There are no routing policies in this small Internet.

    Provide your answers as a comma-separated list of paths starting with the preferred one. For example, the answer::

     AS9:AS1, AS8:AS7:AS1

    indicates that the AS has learned two different paths. The preferred one is the one via ``AS9`` that has a length of 2 AS hops while the second path has a length of 3 AS hops. If there is no path, return 0 as your answer.
