        -   text: In this packet trace, DNS is used over UDP
            valid: true
            feedback: Indeed, the two packets of the trace are both UDP segments.
        -   valid: true
            text: The query of the first packet was for a record of type `NS`
        -   text: The query of the first packet was for a record of type `AAAA`
        -   feedback: This is correct, the high order bit of the `Flags` field is
                set to 0
            text: The first packet contains a query
            valid: true
        -   feedback: This is incorrect, the second packet also contains a query,
                see the `Flags` field
            text: The second packet contains a response
        -   valid: true
            feedback: Indeed, the second packet contains exactly the same information
                as the first one.
            text: The second packet is a retransmission of the first one
        -   text: The identifier of the request in the second packet is `0xedc5`
            valid: true
        -   feedback: This is the `Flags` field
