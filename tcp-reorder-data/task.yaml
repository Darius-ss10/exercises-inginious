    TCP, as explained in the `TCP chapter <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/2nd/html/protocols/tcp.html>`_ of `Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/>`_ includes a sequence number in each segment that carries data.

               bodyHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;

        name: Reorder the segments
        header: During this connection, the client sent some data that was acknowledged
            by the server. Can you reorder the segments based on their sequence numbers
            and acknowledgements ? The trace starts at the third ack of the three-way
            handshake sent by the client to the server.

        shuffle-feedback: Obviously, you need to look at the sequence numbers and
            the acknowledgements. The server listens on port 1234. If you are a bit
            lost, you can look at the data contained in the TCP segments sent by the
            client, their payload could help you...
