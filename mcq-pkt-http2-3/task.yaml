            The attached `packet trace <mcq-pkt-http2-3/nghttp-trace-2768.pcap>`_ was collected while retrieving the home page of http://nghttp2.org

            Using `wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org>`_, verify which of the following affirmations are valid.
        multiple: true
        limit: 7
        choices:
        -   text: The client authorizes the server to push web objects.
            feedback: The `Settings` frame in packet 4 does not disable server push.
                This feature is thus enabled.
            valid: true
        -   text: The client requests three web objects (including the initial request)
            feedback: The client receives four web objects, but only requests three
                of them. The stylesheet (`screen.css`) is automatically pushed by
                the server, see sixth packet.

        -   text: The client requests four web objects (including the initial request)

                the server, see sixth packet.
        -   text: The client sends the `Push_Promise` frame
            feedback: No, the `Push_Promise` frame is sent by the server.
        -   text: The `stylesheet/screen.css` resource is delivered on stream 2
            feedback: In HTTP/2.0, even stream identifiers are used to deliver resources
                pushed by the server, while odd stream numbers are used for resources
                requested by the client. The `Push_Promise` frame in packet 6 clearly
                indicates that this resource will be pushed on stream 2.
            valid: true
        -   text: The `stylesheet/screen.css` resource is delivered on stream 1
            feedback: In HTTP/2.0, even stream identifiers are used to deliver resources

                requested by the client. The `Push_Promise` frame in packet 6 clearly

        -   text: The `/javascript/modernizr-2.0.js` resource is delivered on stream
                2.
            feedback: In HTTP/2.0, even stream identifiers are used to deliver resources
                pushed by the server, while odd stream numbers are used for resources
                requested by the client. The `Push_Promise` frame in packet 15 clearly
                indicates that this resource is expected by the client on stream 3.
        -   text: The `/javascript/modernizr-2.0.js` resource is delivered on stream
                3.
