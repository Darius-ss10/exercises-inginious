    A TCP connection, as explained in the `TCP chapter <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/2nd/html/protocols/tcp.html>`_ of `Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/>`_ starts with a three-way-handshake and ends with the exchange of segments with the `FIN` flag set.

        header: During this connection, the client opens a connection to the server
            that listens on port 1234. It then sends a single byte of data that was
            acknowledged by the server and then decided to terminate the connection.
            Can you reorder all the segments exchanged on this connection ?

        shuffle-feedback: There are a few things that you need to remember to answer
            this question correctly. First, a connection always starts with a three-way
            handshake and the first two segments have their `SYN` flag set. This should
            allow you to correctly reorder the first three segments. Then, the client
            sends one byte (this is the only segment that carries data in the trace)
            and the server acknowledges it. The connection ends with the exchange
            of three segments, two of them have their `FIN` flag set.
