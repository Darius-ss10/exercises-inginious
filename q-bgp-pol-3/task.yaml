    Consider the simple interdomain network shown below where we will look at the impact of the routing policies on the link between ``AS2`` and ``AS4`` on the paths towards the prefix advertised by ``AS2`` that are received by ``AS4``

    Provide your answers as a comma-separated list of paths starting with the preferred one. For example, the answer::

     AS9:AS1, AS8:AS7:AS1

    indicates that the AS has learned two different paths. The preferred one is the one via ``AS9`` that has a length of 2 AS hops while the second path has a length of 3 AS hops. If there is no path, return 0 as your answer.

       bodyHeight = 0;
       function postSize() {
           if (document.body.scrollHeight != bodyHeight) {
               bodyHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
               window.parent.postMessage({height: bodyHeight}, "*");
           }

           document.querySelector('#content').style.minHeight = '';
           setTimeout(postSize, 0);
