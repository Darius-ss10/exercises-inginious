    Consider the simple interdomain topology shown below. In this exercise, we will compute the path from ``AS3`` to ``AS1``. For this, we need to build the routing tables of the other ASes in the topology.

    Provide your answers as a comma-separated list of paths starting with the preferred one. For example, the answer::

     AS9:AS1, AS8:AS7:AS1

    indicates that the AS has learned two different paths. The preferred one is the one via ``AS9`` that has a length of 2 AS hops while the second path has a length of 3 AS hops. If there is no path, return 0 as your answer.

       <script defer>
       bodyHeight = 0;
       function postSize() {
           if (document.body.scrollHeight != bodyHeight) {
               bodyHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
               window.parent.postMessage({height: bodyHeight}, "*");
           }
       };
       var target = document.querySelector('body');

       var observer = new MutationObserver(postSize);

       var config = { attributes: true, subtree: true }

       observer.observe(target, config);
       $(document).ready(function(){
           document.querySelector('#content').style.minHeight = '';
           setTimeout(postSize, 0);
       });
