            The `attached packet trace <mcq-pkt-http2-2/nghttp-trace-1856.pcap>`_ was collected while retrieving the home page of the http://nghttp2.org website

            Download the trace, analyze it with `wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org>`_ and indicate which of the affirmations below are valid.
        multiple: true
        limit: 9
        choices:
        -   text: The client requested four web objects during this trace.
            valid: true
        -   text: The client requested three web objects during this trace.
            feedback: The GET requests appear in packets 4 and 16
        -   text: The client requested five web objects during this trace.
            feedback: The GET requests appear in packets 4 and 16
        -   text: The server pushed one web object to the client
            feedback: The `Settings` frame sent by the client in packet 4 did not
                enable server push.
        -   text: The client sent additional GET requests *before* having received
                the entire response for its first GET
            feedback: The second wave of GET requests are sent in packet 16 while
                the last part of the first response arrives in packet 17.
            valid: true
        -   text: The client always sends a Window Update that contains the same increment
            feedback: The client sends different Windows Updates, see packets 65 and
                93
        -   text: 'The `/javascript/octopress.js` object is sent by the server on
                stream 5 '
            feedback: This is incorrect, packet 16 indicates that the client expects
                this object to be received on stream 7.
        -   text: 'The `/javascript/octopress.js` object is sent by the server on
                stream 7 '
        -   text: The initial response is 6616 bytes long
            feedback: This is the content-length header in the `Headers` frame in
                packet 9
            valid: true
        -   text: The longest object retrieved during this session has a length of
                39082 bytes
            feedback: See the content-length headers in the `Headers` frame in packet
                21
            valid: true
        -   text: The smallest object retrieved during this session has a length of
                6616 bytes
            feedback: This is the initial request for the HTML page. The css and the
                javascript are longer.
            valid: true
        -   text: The longest `Data` frame in this trace has a length of 16384 bytes.
