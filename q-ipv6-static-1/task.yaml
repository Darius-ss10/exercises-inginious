            The forwarding tables used in an IPv6 network define the forwarding paths that are used for the packets. Consider the simple network depicted in the figure below. In this network, the hosts have the following addresses :

             - host ``A`` : ``2001:db8:1341:1::A`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:1::1``
             - host ``B`` : ``2001:db8:1341:3::B`` and its default route points to ``2001:db8:1341:3::3``

            The routers have one address inside each network :

             - router ``R1`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:1::1`` on its West interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:12::1`` on its East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::1`` on its South interface
             - router ``R2`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:12::2`` on its West interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:23::2`` on its South-West interface
             - router ``R3`` uses address ``2001:db8:1341:3::3`` on its East interface, address ``2001:db8:1341:23::3`` on its North-East interface and address ``2001:db8:1341:13::3`` on its North interface

            The forwarding tables of these three routers, ignoring the routes to the local interfaces, are shown in the figure below.
