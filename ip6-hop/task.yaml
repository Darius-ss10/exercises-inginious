    IPv6 is described in the `IPv6 chapter <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/2nd/html/protocols/ipv6.html>`_ of `Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be/>`_. When a router forwards a packet, it updates some of its fields.

       <script defer>
       bodyHeight = 0;
       function postSize() {
           if (document.body.scrollHeight != bodyHeight) {
               bodyHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;
               window.parent.postMessage({height: bodyHeight}, "*");
           }
       };
       var target = document.querySelector('body');

       var observer = new MutationObserver(postSize);

       var config = { attributes: true, subtree: true }

       observer.observe(target, config);

    test:

        name: Packet forwarding
        header: The first packet was captured on an ingress interface of a router.
            The second was captured on its egress interface after having been forwarded.
            Can you infer the different fields of the forwarded  packet ?

        feedback:
            ipv6.dst: A router never changes the Destination Address of the packets
                that it forwards.
            ipv6.hlim: A router always decrements the Hop Limit of the packets that
                it forwards.
            ipv6.nxt: A router never changes the Next Header of the packets that it
                forwards.
            ipv6.plen: A router never changes the payload length of the packets that
                it forwards.
            ipv6.src: A router never changes the Source Address of the packets that
                it forwards.
