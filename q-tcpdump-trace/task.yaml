    Network engineers often need to analyze packet traces. Here is a 2 minutes long packet trace that was collected on a Linux host that used Chrome, Firefox, thunderbird and the brave browser. By analyzing the trace with `wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org>`_, can you answer the following questions ?

        header: The packets in this trace were captured from a single host. What is
            the IPv4 address of this host ? Note that you will find many addresses
            in the trace, look for DNS requests or establishments of TCP connections
            (SYN packets) to find the client address.

        header: The trace contains four connections to an IPv6 server on TCP port
            80. By looking at the content of the packets, can you infer the application
            that created those connections ?
