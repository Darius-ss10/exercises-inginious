                into an IP address
            feedback: Root nameservers only provide the nameservers that are responsible
                for the top-level domains. Do not confuse a root nameserver with a
                resolver.

            text: When a client sends a query to retrieve the IP address corresponding
                to www.computer-networking.info to its local resolver, the resolver
                may need to query different nameservers to return the answer.
