        -   text: The most preferred compression scheme for the server is ``none``
            valid: true
        -   text: The second preferred compression scheme for the server is ``zlib@openssh.com``
            feedback: This compression scheme is the one supported by the zlib library
                that is used in the gzip file compression software.
            valid: true
        -   text: The most preferred compression scheme for the client is ``none``
            feedback: '``none`` is the least preferred compression scheme for the
                client.'
        -   text: The most preferred compression scheme for the client is ``zlib@openssh.com``
            valid: true
        -   text: The second preferred compression scheme for the client is ``zlib``
            valid: true
        -   text: The second preferred compression scheme for the server is ``zlib``
            feedback: The server does not announce the ``zlib`` compression scheme.
        -   text: The encrypted packets sent over this session have been compressed
                with the ``zlib`` compression scheme
            feedback: 'Incorrect, the client and the server agreed on the common and
                most preferred compression scheme: ``zlib@openssh.com``. ``zlib``
                was not announced by the server and thus could not be selected.'

        name: A simple ssh trace
        header: The `attached packet trace <https://inginious.org/course/cnp3/q-pkt-ssh-3/ssh.pcap>`_
            was collected on a Linux server. In the ssh protocol, the client and the
            server can request that data be compressed before encryption. This can
            be useful to speedup transfers in low speed networks. To negotiate the
            compression scheme, the client and the servers propose an ordered list
            in the KeyExchangeInit message.
